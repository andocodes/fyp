# Technical Implementation Challenges

| Challenge | Impact | Resolution Attempt |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Physics simulation stability | Frequent crashes with multiple agents | Tuned parameters, limited agents |
| ROS topic namespacing | Communication errors | Implemented structured namespace scheme |
| ROS to ROS2 migration | Failed | Reverted to ROS Noetic due to sensor compatibility |
| Computational performance | Slow simulation | Reduced simulation complexity, limited agents |
| Obstacle avoidance in complex environments | Navigation failures | Developed SAM state machine |
