# Simulation Environment Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target Value | Measured Value | Notes |
|--------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Physics Stability | >75% stability | 67% stability | Frequent physics anomalies with >3 agents |
| Real-Time Factor | >5× for ≤5 agents | 4.0× for 5 agents | Significantly below target |
| Sensor Update Rate | ≥10Hz | 24Hz average | Met target consistently |
| CPU Utilisation | <80% | 85% with 5 agents | Exceeded target, performance bottleneck |
| RAM Usage | <8GB | 4.3GB with 5 agents | Within acceptable limits |
