# Project Butler Results Summary

Generated on: 2025-04-11 19:51:08

## Overview

This report contains simulated results for Project Butler, generated based on the actual codebase implementation.
The metrics are designed to realistically reflect the system's capabilities and limitations.

## Available Results

- **Performance Metrics**: CPU, RAM, real-time factor, sensor rates
- **Agent Capabilities**: Sensing, communication, processing, movement
- **Swarm Behaviors**: Flocking, formation, exploration
- **System Integration**: Behavior switching, coordination, stability
- **Technical Challenges**: Physics simulation, ROS integration, performance
- **Visualizations**: Example figures of behaviors in action

## Instructions

1. Copy the tables from the Markdown files in each results subdirectory
2. Use the generated images from the 'figures' directory for visualizations
3. Adapt the metrics as needed for your specific report requirements
